# Guess The Number
A simple and fun Python project where the computer generates a random number, and the user has to guess it within a limited number of attempts. This project was built as part of my internship at CloudCredits.

# Features
1. Random number generation using Python’s random module
2. Multiple difficulty levels:
3. Easy → Range: 1–10, Attempts: 5
4. Medium → Range: 1–50, Attempts: 7
5. Hard → Range: 1–100, Attempts: 10
6. Feedback system: tells you if your guess is too high or too low
7. Input validation (only accepts valid numbers)
8. Game over condition when attempts run out
